# My personal structural engineering iPython Notebooks
I've posted and will post a few of my own Jupyterlab/iPython Notebooks here to share. 
Examples of some of these notebooks, in no particular order:
* <b>EC1 Wind load</b></br>
Wind load calculation on a building, based on NEN-EN 1991-1-4 (Eurocode 1, wind loads) and the Dutch National Annex
* <b>HIVOSS_floor_vibration</b></br>
Calculation of the natural frequency of a simply supported beam, based on the Design guideline floor vibrations by HIVOSS
* <b>EC2_section_MNKappa</b></br>
M-N-Kappa capacity calculations for rectangular concrete sections (uses EC2_mat & EC2_funcs sheets)

Some supporting sheets (as mentioned above):
* <b>EC2_mat</b></br>
Some material properties and functions for concrete according to NEN-EN 1992-1-1 (Eurocode 2)
* <b>EC2_funcs</b></br>
Some functions for use in Eurocode 2 related sheets of mine

Please leave your questions and remarks in the comments!
